-## Api
-
-```python
-from transcribe_anyting.api import transcribe
-
-transcribe(
-    url_or_file="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
-    output_dir="output_dir",
-)
-```
-
-## Install GPU/CUDA Accelerated version
-
-GPU acceleration is *much* faster than the CPU version. Install it using the following:
-
-```bash
-> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zackees/transcribe-anything/main/install_cuda.py | python
-# transcribe-anything should now be installed
-> transcribe_anything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
-```
-
-## Develop
-
-Works for Ubuntu/MacOS/Win32(in git-bash)
-This will create a virtual environment
-
-```bash
-> cd transcribe_anything
-> ./install_dev.sh
-# Enter the environment:
-> source activate.sh
-```
-
-The environment is now active and the next step will only install to the local python. If the terminal
-is closed then to get back into the environment `cd transcribe_anything` and execute `source activate.sh`
-
-## Required: Install to current python environment
-  * `pip install transcribe-anything`
-    * The command `transcribe_anything` will magically become available.
-  * `transcribe_anything <YOUTUBE_URL>`

-
-# Versions
-  * 2.3.1: static-ffmpeg >= 2.5 now specified
-  * 2.3.0: Now uses the official version of whisper ai
-  * 2.2.1: "test_" is now prepended to all the different output folder names.
-  * 2.2.0: Now explictly setting a language will put the file in a folder with that language name, allowing multi language passes without overwriting.
-  * 2.1.2: yt-dlp pinned to new minimum version. Fixes downloading issues from old lib. Adds audio normalization by default.
-  * 2.1.1: Updates keywords for easier pypi finding.
-  * 2.1.0: Unknown args are now assumed to be for whisper and passed to it as-is. Fixes https://github.com/zackees/transcribe-anything/issues/3
-  * 2.0.13: Now works with python 3.9
-  * 2.0.12: Adds --device to argument parameters. This will default to CUDA if available, else CPU.

+
+## Api
+
+```python
+from transcribe_anyting.api import transcribe
+
+transcribe(
+    url_or_file="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
+    output_dir="output_dir",
+)
+```
+
+## Install GPU/CUDA Accelerated version
+
+GPU acceleration is *much* faster than the CPU version. Install it using the following:
+
+```bash
+> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zackees/transcribe-anything/main/install_cuda.py | python
+# transcribe-anything should now be installed
+> transcribe_anything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
+```
+
+## Develop
+
+Works for Ubuntu/MacOS/Win32(in git-bash)
+This will create a virtual environment
+
+```bash
+> cd transcribe_anything
+> ./install_dev.sh
+# Enter the environment:
+> source activate.sh
+```
+
+The environment is now active and the next step will only install to the local python. If the terminal
+is closed then to get back into the environment `cd transcribe_anything` and execute `source activate.sh`
+
+## Required: Install to current python environment
+  * `pip install transcribe-anything`
+    * The command `transcribe_anything` will magically become available.
+  * `transcribe_anything <YOUTUBE_URL>`

-## Install GPU/CUDA Accelerated version
-
-GPU acceleration is *much* faster than the CPU version. Install it using the following:

-# transcribe-anything should now be installed
-> transcribe_anything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
-```
-
-## Develop
-
-Works for Ubuntu/MacOS/Win32(in git-bash)
-This will create a virtual environment
-
-```bash
-> cd transcribe_anything
-> ./install_dev.sh
-# Enter the environment:
-> source activate.sh
-```
-
-The environment is now active and the next step will only install to the local python. If the terminal
-is closed then to get back into the environment `cd transcribe_anything` and execute `source activate.sh`
-
-## Required: Install to current python environment
-  * `pip install transcribe-anything`

+### USES WHISPER AI
+
+Input a local file or url and this tool will transcribe it using Whisper AI into subtitle files and raw text.
+
+Uses whisper AI so this is state of the art translation service - completely free. ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯
+
+Your data stays private and is not uploaded to any service.
+
+# Usage (CPU Version)
+
+```bash
+> pip install transcribe-anything
+# Outputs the srt, vtt and txt files in title/out.vtt
+> transcribe_anything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
+```
+
+# Usage (GPU Accelerated Version) (works on Python 3.10.X)
+
+```bash
+> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zackees/transcribe-anything/main/install_cuda.py | python
+# Outputs the srt, vtt and txt files in title/out.vtt
+> transcribe_anything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
+```
+
+Will output:
